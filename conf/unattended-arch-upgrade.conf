# NEWS #
########

# THIS IS THE REGULAR WAY TO USE UAU AND YOU HAVE TO ADJUST IT
# TO FIT YOUR NEEDS
# THE WHOLE PART HERE WILL (SHOULD) NOT DO ANY HARM ON YOUR SYSTEM

# what args are required to enforce a REALLY FULL AUR database REFRESH (no upgrade here!)
AURNEWSSYNCARG="-Syy"

# uAu fetches once per day (cron) available updates and the Arch news feed.
# if you want to send an email after the news feed was fetched select yes here.
#
# valid options: yes|no
NEWSMAIL=yes

# when set to 0 more detailed information (e.g. current version -> available version) will be shown
# for every package which is updatable. 
# if set to 1:
#  - you will get one single line with the package names only 
#  - uAu will still show relevant Arch News for a package if available
#  - the general news at the bottom will show UNREAD news only! That means it will show you the news
#    once and then only when something new comes up
#
# valid options: 0|1
BRIEFNEWS=0

# when set to 0 you will receive the amount of comments specified in AURCOMMENTS for every updatable
# package. when set to 1 you will get the last comment only (this overwrites AURCOMMENTS)
#
# valid options: 0|1
BRIEFNEWSAUR=0

# the default amount of AUR comments for a package (when BRIEFNEWSAUR=0).
# this will be enforced to 1 when BRIEFNEWSAUR=1 regardless what you define here
# you can disable AUR comments completely by setting BRIEFNEWSAUR=0 and AURCOMMENTS=0!
#
# valid options: 0|1|2|.... (any positive integer)

###########
#
# THIS SECTION IS THE DANGEROUS PART OF UAU AND SHOULD BE ADJUSTED
# WHEN YOU HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF ITS IMPACTS ONLY!
######################################################################################

# if you want to send an email after an unattended upgrade set this to 'yes'.
# (unattended upgrades will start the newsreader as well but ensures that you will
# get 1 mail only)
#
# valid options: yes|no
UPGRADEMAIL=yes

# set this to actually ACTIVATE the unattended upgrade!
# means when you leave this at its default "disabled" no unattended system upgrade 
# will happen (you will still receive uAu news though!).
#
# valid options: "disabled"|"I understand that this could break my system"

# (ALL in CAPITAL letters and instead of a SPACE type a dash '-' ("THIS-IS-AN-EXAMPLE")

#       avoid anything else printed then package names
